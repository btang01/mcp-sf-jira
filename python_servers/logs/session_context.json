Revenue/Opportunity size**\n**2. Number of open opportunities**\n**3. Account activity level**\n**4. Number of cases/support requests**\n\nLet's approach this systematically:\n\n**1. First, let's look at accounts that have active opportunities:**\n\n---\n\nBased on the data, let me analyze the most important accounts:\n\n**1. **United Oil & Gas Corp.** appears to be the most significant account:**\n\u2022 5 open opportunities totaling $1,340,000 (plus one without amount)\n\u2022 5 open cases indicating high engagement\n\u2022 Highest total opportunity value and most active account\n\n**2. **Grand Hotels & Resorts Ltd**:**\n\u2022 2 open opportunities totaling $265,000\n\u2022 One very large opportunity of $250,000\n\n**3. **Express Logistics and Transport**:**\n\u2022 2 open opportunities totaling $200,000\n\u2022 Significant deal sizes ($80,000 and $120,000)\n\n**4. **GenePoint**:**\n\u2022 1 open opportunity for $60,000\n\u2022 Has an open case indicating active engagement\n\n**5. **WalkMart**:**\n\u2022 1 open opportunity (amount not specified)\n\u2022 2 open cases showing active support needs\n\nLet me also check if there are any other important details about these accounts by looking at additional fields:I encountered an error: Server disconnected\nI apologize for the error in the follow-up query. However, based on the initial data, here are my recommendations for the most important accounts:\n\nTOP PRIORITY ACCOUNTS:\n\n1. **United Oil & Gas Corp.**\n   - Highest value ($1.34M+ in opportunities)\n   - Most active (5 opportunities, 5 cases)\n   - Requires immediate attention due to high activity level\n\n2. **Grand Hotels & Resorts Ltd**\n   - High-value account ($265K in opportunities)\n   - Has a significant single opportunity ($250K)\n   - Strategic importance due to deal size\n\n3. **Express Logistics and Transport**\n   - Solid mid-tier account ($200K in opportunities)\n   - Multiple active opportunities showing growth potential\n\nACCOUNTS TO WATCH:\n\n4. **GenePoint**\n   - Active engagement (open case + $60K opportunity)\n   - Shows potential for growth\n\n5. **WalkMart**\n   - Multiple open cases indicate active relationship\n   - Requires attention due to support needs\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Dig deeper into any of these specific accounts?\n2. Look at recent activities for these accounts?\n3. Analyze their opportunities in more detail?\n4. Check for any related Jira issues?\n\nLet me know what aspect you'd like to explore further!",

Let's also check for cases to see which accounts have active support needs:**\n\nLet me explain my SOQL queries:\n\n1. First query looks for:\n   - Account Name and ID\n   - Count of opportunities per account\n   - Sum of opportunity amounts\n   - Only open opportunities (IsClosed = FALSE)\n   - Ordered by total amount descending\n   - Limited to top 10\n\n2. Second query looks for:\n   - Account Name and ID\n   - Count of cases per account\n   - Only open cases (IsClosed = FALSE)\n   - Ordered by case count descending\n   - Limited to top 10\n\nThese queries give us a good picture of:\n- Which accounts have the highest value in open opportunities\n- Which accounts have the most active support needs\n- Combined, this helps identify the most important accounts based on both business opportunity and support engagement\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Run additional queries to look at other aspects?\n2. Modify these queries to look at different fields?\n3. Dig deeper into any specific account?",

Let me be transparent and run some real queries now:\n\nLet's start with a query to find important accounts:\n\nLet me break down this query:\n1. `SELECT Account.Name, Account.Id`\n   - Gets basic account information\n2. `(SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunities WHERE IsClosed = FALSE)`\n   - Sub-query to get all open opportunities for each account\n3. `(SELECT Id FROM Cases WHERE IsClosed = FALSE)`\n   - Sub-query to get all open cases for each account\n4. `FROM Account`\n   - Main object we're querying\n5. `ORDER BY Name`\n   - Sorts results alphabetically by account name\n6. `LIMIT 10`\n   - Returns only first 10 records\n\nFrom these results, we can see several interesting accounts:\n1. Express Logistics and Transport has 2 open opportunities totaling $200,000\n2. GenePoint has 1 open opportunity for $60,000 and an open case\n3. Edge Communications has an opportunity for $35,000\n4. Dickenson plc has an opportunity for $15,000\n5. Ballmart has an opportunity for $10,000 and an open case\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Modify this query to look at different fields?\n2.
