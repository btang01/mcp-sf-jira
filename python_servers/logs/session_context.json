Let me be transparent and run some real queries now:\n\nLet's start with a query to find important accounts:\n\nLet me break down this query:\n1. `SELECT Account.Name, Account.Id`\n   - Gets basic account information\n2. `(SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunities WHERE IsClosed = FALSE)`\n   - Sub-query to get all open opportunities for each account\n3. `(SELECT Id FROM Cases WHERE IsClosed = FALSE)`\n   - Sub-query to get all open cases for each account\n4. `FROM Account`\n   - Main object we're querying\n5. `ORDER BY Name`\n   - Sorts results alphabetically by account name\n6. `LIMIT 10`\n   - Returns only first 10 records\n\nFrom these results, we can see several interesting accounts:\n1. Express Logistics and Transport has 2 open opportunities totaling $200,000\n2. GenePoint has 1 open opportunity for $60,000 and an open case\n3. Edge Communications has an opportunity for $35,000\n4. Dickenson plc has an opportunity for $15,000\n5. Ballmart has an opportunity for $10,000 and an open case\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Modify this query to look at different fields?\n2. Run a query with different sorting (e.g., by opportunity amount)?\n3. Look deeper into any specific account?\n4. Query for additional information like recent activities?",
