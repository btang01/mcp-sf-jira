# Docker Configuration Simplification

## What Was Done

### âœ… Removed Production Complexity
- **Deleted**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` - No longer needed for demo project
- **Simplified**: Single docker-compose configuration for all use cases
- **Cleaned**: Removed production references from build scripts

### âœ… Updated Build Scripts
- **Removed**: `prod` command from `scripts/docker-build.sh`
- **Simplified**: Commands now focus on `dev`, `clean`, `rebuild`, `prune`
- **Fixed**: Path references to work with new folder structure

### âœ… Updated Documentation
- **README.md**: Removed production deployment instructions
- **Build Scripts**: Updated help text and examples
- **Project Structure**: Cleaned up file listings

### âœ… Removed Docker Warnings
- **Fixed**: Removed obsolete `version: '3.8'` from docker-compose.yml
- **Clean**: No more version warnings when running docker-compose

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified User Experience**
- **One Command**: `docker-compose up` - that's it!
- **No Confusion**: No more choosing between dev/prod
- **Faster Onboarding**: New users can get started immediately

### ðŸ§¹ **Cleaner Codebase**
- **Less Maintenance**: Only one docker-compose file to maintain
- **Fewer Files**: Removed unnecessary production configuration
- **Clear Purpose**: Each remaining file has a clear, single purpose

### ðŸ“š **Better Documentation**
- **Focused**: Documentation now focuses on getting things working
- **Practical**: Examples show real commands users will run
- **Consistent**: All docs point to the same simple workflow

## Current Workflow

### For Users
```bash
# Start the demo
cd docker && docker-compose up

# Stop the demo  
cd docker && docker-compose down
```

### For Developers
```bash
# Build images
./scripts/docker-build.sh dev

# Clean up
./scripts/docker-build.sh clean

# Force rebuild
./scripts/docker-build.sh rebuild
```

## Result

The project is now **much more approachable** for anyone who wants to:
- âœ… Try out the MCP demo
- âœ… Understand how it works
- âœ… Contribute to development
- âœ… Deploy it somewhere

**No more confusion about which version to use - there's only one way, and it works!** ðŸŽ‰
