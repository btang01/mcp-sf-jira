## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **Writing Good Queries**
- **Be specific**: *"Show me high-priority cases"* vs *"Show me cases"*
- **Use timeframes**: *"opportunities closing this month"*
- **Combine systems**: *"customers with both deals and support cases"*

### **Performance Tips**
- Limit large queries: *"Show me top 10 opportunities"*
- Use filters: *"accounts in California"*
- Be patient with complex cross-system queries

### **Data Privacy**
- This system accesses your real business data
- Use appropriate filters for sensitive information
- Test queries with small datasets first
